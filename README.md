# shufti

## A persistent, PyQt5-based image viewer

### By Dan MacDonald, 2017

shufti is a simple PyQt5 and SQLite database powered image viewer. It's special feature, and the reason it was created, is that it automatically saves and restores the zoom level, window size, desktop location and the scrollbar positions on a per-image basis for every image it loads.

shufti has no real UI but that is by design. The only missing features I would like to see added are support for mousewheel zoom and the ability to point it to a directory of images and be able to browse through them with a keypress and/or a mouse/touch action.

Due to its very nature, shufti will only be of use if you maintain the same display configuration ie screen / desktop config and resolution(s).

Have a good shufti!
